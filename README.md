# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
This Python script implements an efficient algorithm for detecting anomalies in continuous data streams. The simulated data stream represents real-time sequences of floating-point numbers, applicable to various metrics such as financial transactions and system metrics. 
Objectives
Algorithm Selection
Choose an algorithm capable of handling concept drift and seasonality for effective anomaly detection in dynamic data streams.

Data Stream Simulation
Implement a function to simulate a data stream, incorporating a pattern, seasonal component, and noise to replicate real-world scenarios.

Anomaly Detection
Develop a real-time anomaly detection mechanism that flags anomalies as the data stream is being processed.

Optimization
Ensure the algorithm is optimized for speed and efficiency, considering the continuous nature of data streaming.

Visualization
Provide a simple real-time visualization of the data stream, highlighting detected anomalies for easy interpretation.

Used the dataset of credit cards to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
